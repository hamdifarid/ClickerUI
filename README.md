# ClickerUI
An app made to help people with automated clicking. 
 - Can be used with games where a mouse cursor is needed. For example, Roblox, Clicker Heroes.
 - The app currently has three features.
 - **Press Shift + Y to stop clicking.**
## Indiscriminate clicking (Shift + H) to start 
- Clicks are indiscriminate based on the last set delay. 
## Area based Clicking (Shift + G) to start
 - Set the X1, X2, Y1,Y2 coordinates to create a rectangle or square on the screen to click only when the mouse is in that region. 
 - The programme automatically stores the data in a file to recall last created rectangle and speed.
## Color Clicking (Shift + D) to start (EXPERIMENTAL MAY NOT WORK PROPERLY YET)!!!
 - Select a specific color to click on
